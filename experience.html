                <li>During my two-month internship at Muqmeen Group Wangsa Maju, I had the opportunity to gain real working experience in the Takaful industry. 
        Muqmeen Group is a professional agency under Prudential BSN Takaful Berhad (PruBSN) that focuses on providing Islamic insurance services and financial protection plans.
                </li>
                <li>Throughout my internship, I was mainly involved in administrative and marketing tasks such as organizing documents, managing data and assisting with client-related activities. 
        I also learned about the agency’s operations, sales process and how Takaful products help individuals and families achieve financial security.
                </li>
                <li>This experience taught me the importance of professionalism, teamwork and customer service. It also gave me a clearer understanding of how financial planning and protection work in real life.

       They were always kind to me and treated me like their little sister. 
       From the very first day, they made me feel comfortable and welcomed in the office. 
       They often taught me things I didn’t know, answered my questions patiently and even invited me to join them for lunch. 
                </li>
                <li>Sometimes, we would chat, joke around and even watch horror movies together in the office during our free time. 
       Those moments were so much fun and made my internship days more enjoyable. 
       Even though there was about a six-year age gap between us, we got along so well and I truly appreciated their warmth and care. 
       Spending time with them created many sweet memories that I’ll always remember.
